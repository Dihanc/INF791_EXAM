NLP Assignment
Let's break down the provided notebook into comprehensive notes, explaining each section, step-by-step. We'll include detailed explanations for the code, what it does, and why it's being used. I'll divide this into multiple sections to ensure clarity and organization.
?? Comprehensive Notes on the Given Code



?? Section 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing
?? Objective

Load the data from an Excel file. Ensure columns are correctly named.
Create dictionaries for translation and sentiment scoring. Prepare data for visualization and machine learning.



Code Breakdown

Explanation

1. Data Loading:
is used to load the Excel file.
Ensure the dataset is correctly imported by renaming columns to


2. Why This Step?
Proper column naming is essential for clear identification and easier data manipulation.



?? Section 2: Creating Dictionaries for Translation and Sentiment Scoring
Objective

Create translation and scoring dictionaries to convert French text into Ciluba and assign sentiment scores to words.
Code Breakdown

# Create translation and scoring dictionaries from the dataset translation_lexique = dict(zip(df['french'].str.lower(), df['ciluba'])) lexique = dict(zip(df['ciluba'].str.lower(), df['score']))

def translate_text_using_lexicon(text, translation_lexique): words = text.lower().split()
translated_words = [translation_lexique.get(word, word) for word in words] translated_text = ' '.join(translated_words)
return translated_text

def analyse_sentiment(text): words = text.lower().split()
word_scores = {word: lexique.get(word, 0) for word in words} score = sum(word_scores.values())
if score > 0.05: sentiment = "Positif"
elif score < -0.05: sentiment = "Négatif"
else:
sentiment = "Neutre"
return score, sentiment, word_scores

Explanation

1. Creating Dictionaries:
translation_lexique : Translates French words into Ciluba using a dictionary.

lexique : Assigns sentiment scores to Ciluba words.
2. Translation Function:
translate_text_using_lexicon() : Converts French text into Ciluba using the dictionary.
3. Sentiment Analysis Function:
calculates the sentiment score based on the provided lexique
dictionary.
The sentiment is classified as: Positif if the score > 0.05. Négatif if the score < -0.05. Neutre otherwise.



Testing Translation and Sentiment Analysis

Explanation

This section tests the translation and sentiment analysis functions. Converts a French sentence to Ciluba and calculates the sentiment score.



?? Section 3: Data Visualization

Objective

Visualize the distribution of categorical data to understand its composition.

Code Breakdown

Explanation

1. Visualization of Categorical Data:
is used to show the frequency of each unique value in each
column.
Useful for understanding the distribution of data across categories.
2. Why This Step?
Helps identify potential class imbalances and understand the dataset's structure.



?? Section 4: Data Encoding and Feature Scaling for Machine Learning
Objective

Convert categorical data into numerical format using Label Encoding. Standardize numerical features for better model performance.
Code Breakdown


from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler

# Encode the 'sentiment' and 'nature' columns into numerical labels label_encoder_sentiment = LabelEncoder()
df['sentiment_encoded'] = label_encoder_sentiment.fit_transform(df['sentiment']) label_encoder_nature = LabelEncoder()
df['nature_encoded'] = label_encoder_nature.fit_transform(df['nature'])

# Prepare features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['score', 'sentiment_encoded']] y = df['nature_encoded']

# Convert 'score' to numeric, if it's not already
X['score'] = pd.to_numeric(X['score'], errors='coerce').fillna(0)

# Scale the features scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

Explanation

1. Label Encoding:
Converts categorical variables ( sentiment and nature ) into numerical labels.
2. Feature Scaling:
standardizes features to have a mean of 0 and standard
deviation of 1.
This improves model performance, especially for algorithms like k-NN and SVM.



?? Section 5: Building a Machine Learning Model
Objective


Train a Random Forest model to classify the

Code Breakdown

of text based on features.






Explanation

1. Train-Test Split:
Splits the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2. Model Training:
Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict the nature of text based on sentiment and score.



?? Section 6: Model Evaluation using Confusion Matrix
Objective

Evaluate the performance of the model using a Confusion Matrix.

Code Breakdown




Explanation

1. Confusion Matrix:
Displays the performance of the model in terms of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.
2. Why This Step?
Useful for evaluating classification performance and identifying areas where the model may be misclassifying.



?? Conclusion & Insights

This notebook demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for loading data, translating text, analyzing sentiment, visualizing distributions, encoding categorical variables, training a machine learning model, and evaluating it.
The techniques used here (label encoding, feature scaling, and Random Forest) are fundamental for text classification tasks.
