Loading and Preprocessing the UGRansom Dataset
Before using Lazy Predict, let's preprocess the UGRansom dataset.
Loading and Preprocessing the UGRansom Dataset
Before using Lazy Predict, let's preprocess the UGRansom dataset.
import pandas as pd
from Lazypredict.Supervised import LazyClassifier
TLum sKLeacn.model_selection import train_test_spLlit
import pandas as pd
from lazypredict.Supervised import LazyClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# Load the UGRansom dataset
file_path ='path/to/ugransome.csv' # Update with your dataset path
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
file path = 'path/to/ugransome.csv'
ut = pd.read_csv(file_path)
# Display dataset information
print("Dataset shape:", df.shape)
print("Dataset shape:", df.shape)

print(df.head())
# Feature selection: Assuming 'score' and 'sentiment' are features, and
'threat' is the target
X = df[['score','sentiment_encoded']]
y = df['nature_encoded']
# Handling missing values if any
X = X.fillna(0)
# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2,
random_state=42)
# Apply Lazy Predict
clf = LazyClassifier(verbose=0, ignore_warnings=True, custom_metric=None)
models, predictions = clf.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
# Display the top models
print(models.head(10))
Analysis of Results
Accuracy: Displays the accuracy of each model.
F1 Score: Useful for understanding performance when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
Inference Time: Helps in selecting models for real-time applications.
2. Unsupervised Learning on UGRansom
Dataset
Unsupervised Learning Overview
Unsupervised learning involves discovering patterns and hidden structures in unlabeled data.
For the UGRansom dataset, unsupervised learning can be particularly useful for anomaly
detection and clustering network traffic to identify potential intrusions.
Clustering with K-Means
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
# Load the UGRansom dataset
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
# Feature selection
features =['score','sentiment_encoded']
X = df[features]
# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
# Apply KMeans clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['Cluster']= kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
# Visualize the clusters
sns.pairplot(df, hue='Cluster', palette='viridis')
plt.title("K-Means Clustering of UGRansom Data")
plt.show()
Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
# Fit the Isolation Forest model
isolation_forest = IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, contamination=0.1,
random_state=42)
df['anomaly']= isolation_forest.fit_predict(X_scaled)
# Visualize anomalies
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='score', y='sentiment_encoded', hue='anomaly',
palette={1:'green',-1:'red'})
plt.title("Anomaly Detection on UGRansom Data")
plt.show()
Use Cases
Clustering: Segment network traffic data into different clusters to identify potential attack
patterns.
Anomaly Detection: Flag unusual patterns in the data that may indicate intrusions.

3. Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) on
UGRansom Dataset
Overview of Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes that the features
are independent of each other, which makes it simple and efficient. For UGRansom data, we
can use Naive Bayes for classifying network threats.
Naive Bayes Implementation
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report,
confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Load the dataset and preprocess
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
# Encode categorical features
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le_sentiment = LabelEncoder()
df['sentiment_encoded']= le_sentiment.fit_transform(df['sentiment'])
le_nature = LabelEncoder()
df['nature_encoded']= le_nature.fit_transform(df['nature'])
# Prepare features and target variable
X = df[['score','sentiment_encoded']]
y = df['nature_encoded']
# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2,
random_state=42)
# Train Naive Bayes model
nb_model = MultinomialNB()
nb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Make predictions
y_pred = nb_model.predict(X_test)
# Evaluate model

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
# Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm,
display_labels=le_nature.classes_)
disp.plot(cmap='Blues')
plt.title("Confusion Matrix - Naive Bayes on UGRansom Data")
plt.show()
Interpreting the Results
Accuracy: Measures how often the model is correct.
Precision & Recall: Useful for evaluating performance on imbalanced datasets.
Confusion Matrix: Shows the counts of actual vs predicted classifications.
Use Cases
Spam Filtering: Identifying malicious network traffic based on historical data.
Threat Classification: Categorizing the type of threat (e.g., spam, SSH, DoS) based on
network features.
Conclusion
Summary
Lazy Predict quickly benchmarks various models and gives you an idea of which
algorithms are worth fine-tuning.
Unsupervised Learning can be effectively used for anomaly detection and clustering in
cybersecurity data.
Naive Bayes is a powerful and efficient method for classifying network threats using
labeled data.
Next Steps
Perform Hyperparameter Tuning on models that performed well using Lazy Predict.
Apply Dimensionality Reduction techniques like PCA if the dataset has too many
features.

Use Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand why a model made certain
predictions.
These techniques provide a robust approach to analyzing the UGRansom dataset, helping
identify patterns and classify network intrusions effectively.
