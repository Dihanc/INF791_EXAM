you can fully understand what's happening at each step, along with explanations of the parameters used.
?? Phase 1: Data Collection and Loading

Explanation:

pd.read_csv() : Loads the dataset from the specified path.
is the path to your dataset.
Renaming Columns: Assigns readable column names to improve clarity.



?? Data Cleaning
Step 1: Correcting Misspelled Values

Explanation:

str.replace() : Corrects spelling mistakes in the 'Threats' column.

Step 2: Dropping Duplicate Rows

Explanation:

drop_duplicates() : Removes rows that are identical.



?? Data Transformation

Handling the 'Time' Column

Explanation:

This is used to shift all time entries by 11 units, possibly for correcting time zone differences or alignment.
Applying Mathematical Transformations to Reduce Skewness

Transformations help normalize data distribution, making it easier for models to learn patterns.

Log Transformation on


np.log() : Compresses the range of data, especially useful for right-skewed distributions.
+1 : Ensures no issues with log(0), as the logarithm of zero is undefined.

Square Root Transformation on


np.sqrt() : Reduces skewness but is less aggressive than log transformations.

Yeo-Johnson Transformation on


Yeo-Johnson: Handles both positive and negative values, making it more versatile than Box-Cox.



?? Data Normalization and Scaling

Explanation:

StandardScaler: Scales features to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Normalization is essential for models sensitive to feature scaling (e.g., SVM, KNN).



?? Data Visualization
Plotting Transformed Data Distributions

Explanation:

plt.hist() : Plots histograms for visualizing the distribution of transformed features. Multiple histograms are overlaid to compare distributions.
Density Plot of Normalized Features




?? Encoding Categorical Variables

from sklearn import preprocessing

lab_encoder = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
df2['Protocol'] = lab_encoder.fit_transform(df2['Protocol']) df2['Flag'] = lab_encoder.fit_transform(df2['Flag']) df2['Family'] = lab_encoder.fit_transform(df2['Family'])
df2['SeedAddress'] = lab_encoder.fit_transform(df2['SeedAddress']) df2['ExpAddress'] = lab_encoder.fit_transform(df2['ExpAddress']) df2['IPaddress'] = lab_encoder.fit_transform(df2['IPaddress'])



Explanation:

LabelEncoder: Converts categorical values into numeric labels.



?? Model Training and Evaluation
Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets

Explanation:

train_test_split(): Splits the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.



?? Ensemble Models: Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

# Random Forest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42) rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
rf_pred = rf.predict(X_test)
rf_accuracy = accuracy_score(rf_pred, y_test)

# SVM
svr = LinearSVC() svr.fit(X_train, y_train) svr_pred = svr.predict(X_test)
svr_accuracy = accuracy_score(svr_pred, y_test)

# Naive Bayes
nb = GaussianNB() nb.fit(X_train, y_train)



Explanation:

RandomForestClassifier: Uses an ensemble of decision trees for classification.
LinearSVC: A linear support vector classifier.
GaussianNB: Naive Bayes classifier for normally distributed data.
