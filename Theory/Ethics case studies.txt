Essay on Case Study 1: Cambridge Analytica and
Facebook Data Scandal
Introduction
The Cambridge Analytica and Facebook data scandal represents a pivotal moment in the
discourse on data ethics, privacy, and the misuse of personal information in the digital age. The
unauthorized harvesting and exploitation of personal data for political manipulation not only
violated individual privacy rights but also highlighted significant ethical lapses in data science
practices. This case underscores the urgent need for robust ethical frameworks, transparency,
and compliance with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect
user data and maintain public trust.

Ethical Dilemmas in Data Science
Understanding Personal Data
Personal Data: Information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, such as
names, addresses, and online identifiers.
Sensitive Data: A subset of personal data requiring extra protection, including health
records, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and sexual orientation.
Anonymized Data: Data modified to prevent the identification of individuals. However,
with big data analytics, there's a risk of re-identifying individuals from anonymized
datasets.
In this case, Cambridge Analytica accessed personal and sensitive data without proper
consent, breaching ethical standards for handling such information.

Informed Consent
Informed consent is a fundamental ethical principle requiring that individuals are fully aware of
and agree to how their data will be collected, used, and shared. Cambridge Analytica's methods
lacked transparency, and users were not adequately informed about the extent of data
collection and its intended use for political profiling.

Data Ownership and Privacy Laws

Data Ownership: Individuals have rights over their personal data, but platforms like
Facebook often have terms that grant them extensive control over user data.
Privacy Laws: Regulations like the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act
(CCPA) mandate strict guidelines for data protection, including the requirement of informed
consent and the right to access or delete personal data.
Cambridge Analytica's actions violated these principles, disregarding the legal and ethical
obligations to protect user data.

Lack of Transparency and Explainability
The algorithms used for psychological profiling were opaque, preventing users and regulators
from understanding how their data influenced political campaigns. This lack of explainability
hinders accountability and violates ethical standards that call for transparent AI models.

Autonomous Decision-Making
The deployment of algorithms to influence voter behavior without human oversight raises
concerns about autonomous systems making critical decisions. The manipulation of public
opinion through automated processes challenges ethical norms regarding human autonomy
and informed decision-making.

Factors Leading to the Ethical Breaches
Inadequate Compliance with Privacy Regulations
Non-Compliance with GDPR: Although the GDPR was enacted after the scandal, the
principles it embodies highlight the deficiencies in Cambridge Analytica's practices.
Insufficient Data Protection Measures: Facebook's lax data access policies allowed
third-party apps to collect extensive user data without proper safeguards.

Ethical Challenges in Big Data
Re-identification Risks: The aggregation of large datasets increased the risk of reidentifying individuals from supposedly anonymized data.
Surveillance and Data Exploitation: The misuse of data for political manipulation
exemplifies the dangers of data exploitation without ethical oversight.

Research Integrity and Publication Ethics
Lack of Transparency: The methodologies used were not transparent, violating ethical
standards in research and data publication.

Bias and Manipulation: The data was used to create biased profiles, influencing political
outcomes without accountability.
