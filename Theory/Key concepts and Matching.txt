Note: Remember that in true/false questions, statements can be slightly altered to test
understanding. In matching questions, concepts should be clearly defined to ensure accurate
matching.

Tips for True/False Questions:
Read the statement carefully; look out for absolutes like "always" or "never."
Consider the definitions and key characteristics of concepts.
Think about exceptions to general rules.

Tips for Matching Questions:
Understand each term and its definition.
Eliminate options that are clearly incorrect to narrow down choices.
Be aware of similar-sounding terms and avoid confusion.

By familiarizing yourself with these key concepts and their correct associations, you'll be wellprepared to tackle true/false and matching questions on your exam. Good luck with your
